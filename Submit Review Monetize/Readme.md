## Submission Checklist 

By reviewing every plugin submission, Adobe aims to help developers get ready for primetime and ensure that users have great experiences with the plugins they install. 

This document will give you an idea of what we're checking for during the review process. While lengthy, working through the points below will help you make sure you've accounted for all the requirements and avoid having to fix things and resubmit before getting published. 


1.  ***Plugin Description*** 

 -   A plugin name can only include "Adobe Photoshop" if it fits the pattern "\${Plugin Name} for Photoshop". Refer to the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf) for further information. For example: 

 -   OK: "Rectanglator", or "Rectanglator for Adobe Photoshop" 

 -   Not OK: "PS Rectanglator", or "Rectanglator PS". "Rectanglator PS" would be rejected based on the plugin name. 

 -   The plugin description must be both relevant and self-explanatory. 

 -   Regardless of supported languages, an English description must be provided. 

 -   All listing content, including author name, email address, and website must comply with [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide-062218.pdf) . 

 -   Any plugin website must provide an email address or contact form so that the users can contact the plugin developer easily.  (We will check your provided website to confirm this information is present.) 

 -   The listing should not link to the websites that are still under development (i.e., "under construction", "coming soon", etc.). 


2.  ***Icons, screenshots and videos*** 

-   Plugin icons must not contain Adobe product assets or icons. (Please note that many submissions are rejected because they contain Adobe product icons.) 

-   Plugin icons must be clear and free of distortion. 

-   Plugin icons should be clearly visible when the Creative Cloud desktop app is set to dark mode. 

-   Screenshots in the listing must not contain Adobe product assets or icons without prior permission from Adobe Branding team (CCDeveloperMarketing@adobe.com or brand@adobe.com). 

-   The videos in the listing must be relevant to the plugin/publisher. They should not contain any Adobe assets or icons  without getting permission from the Adobe  Branding team  (CCDeveloperMarketing@adobe.com or brand@adobe.com). 


3.  ***Adobe Branding Guidelines*** 

-   Make sure to review and adhere to the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf). 

-   Avoid using publisher names, domain names, email addresses, and other such property names that are confusingly similar to existing Adobe brand, product, or service names.  Eg: <adobexd@gmail.com>, <AdobePS@gmmail.com> or XYZforAdobe.com 

-   Using Adobe assets and icons in your plugin or your plugin marketing material requires explicit permission from Adobe (login required). Note that getting permission to use Adobe branding assets can add to the time it takes to get your plugin reviewed, approved and published.


4.  ***Inappropriate Content*** 

-   The plugin and associated marketing surfaces must not include any intense violence, blood, gore, sexual content, nudity, or strong language. 

-   The plugin must not promote or conduct phishing, spamming, hacking, password trafficking, or spyware, nor contain malware, trojans, or viruses. 


5.  ***External Services*** 

-   If your plugin requires paid credentials, when you submit your plugin to Adobe, you must provide test credentials for login, license key, API Key, or anything else that would be required to fully review your plugin. 

-   All plugin functionalities must be accessible, either openly or through the credentials that you provide to Adobe, for Adobe's reviewers. 


6.  ***Installation Instructions*** 

-   If a  plugin requires additional steps before it can be used with the Adobe products, the steps need to be present in the "Where to find it" section. For example: After acquiring the plugin from the Creative Cloud desktop application, the user needs to perform more steps like moving or placing some files at desired location and  such instructions must be clearly mentioned in the "Where to find it" section. 

-   Installation instructions should be present for all the supported point products. 

-   Instructions should be clear and precise so that end users can locate the  plugin for each supported point product. 


7.  ***Product: ZXP installation*** 

-   The ZXP must install  successfully. 

-   After installation, the plugin  should be visible at the desired place as mentioned in "Where to find it" section. 

-   After opening the ZIP, if the resulting file is an EXE and/or DMG, ensure that the file plugin matches the supported platform(s) noted in the listing information (for example "Windows only."). 


8.  ***Plugin functionality and UI (User Interface)*** 

Once the user  installs the plugin, we make sure that the newly added plugin is working seamlessly, and customers can use it  to enhance their productivity. 

    a.  Functionality: 

        1. The plugin must install without error. 

        2. The plugin should  launch successfully in the maximum supported version of the point product. 

        3. The plugin should  launch successfully in the minimum supported version of the point product. 

        4. Modal dialogs must provide an affordance in the UI for closing the modal (e.g., a cancel/close button). 

        5. The plugin must never show a completely blank UI. 

        6. The plugin  shouldn't get stuck on any screens with no way to navigate out. 

        7. The plugin must indicate to the user if an internet connection is not available but is required. 

        8. The plugin must work as described by the developer. 

        9. All the external links that are added to the plugin must open a website when clicked. 


    b.  User Interface 

        1. UI elements in the plugin must not overlap or truncate. 

        2. Plugin content must follow  [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf). 

        3. No content should be clipped. 

        4. UI content must wrap or adapt as necessary to accommodate the available width of the UI. 

        5. The plugin UI must scroll when all content is not visible on the screen. 


9.  ***Performance*** 

-   The plugin must not degrade the performance of Adobe products. 

-   The plugin must load in a timely manner. 

-   The plugin must not cause abnormal resource usage (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage). 

-   The plugin must not cause crashes, system errors, or any major failures. 

10.  ***License distribution***

-   Developers can mention details of license keys in the "Notes to approver" section. 


#  Top 3 Rejection Reasons 

During the review process, we check plugins with the aim to make sure users have positive experiences with the plugins they install. Sometimes developers' plugins are rejected during the process, particularly when submitting a plugin for the first time. When that happens, we request certain changes be made before they are re-submitted for review.


During the review process, we check plugins with the aim to make sure users have positive experiences with the plugins they install. Sometimes developers' plugins are rejected during the process, particularly when submitting a plugin for the first time. When that happens, we request certain changes be made before they are re-submitted for review.


1.  Non-compliance with Adobe Branding Guidelines. 

          a.  Developers often use Adobe brand assets without getting prior permission, (for example, Adobe's "A" icon).  This violates the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf). It is advised that before you start using the Adobe assets, please get permission from the Adobe Branding Team by contacting them at <brand@adobe.com>. Once the permissions are granted you can start using Adobe  assets on your  website and in  your  screenshots.


1.  Plugin does not function as described by the developer. 

         a.  At the time of testing, the review team validates all of  the functionality of your plugin. Please make sure before submission that your plugin is functioning as  advertised, and all the features are working properly. 

         b.  Silent failures: If the plugin user attempts an unsupported function, the plugin must not fail silently. Plugins must display a dialog that this action/functionality is not supported so that users understand it and avoid repeating the same action. 

         c.  Your plugin is compatible with all of  the Adobe products, product versions, and operating systems you listed in the "Product Compatibility Information" section of your listing.


1.  Insufficient installation instructions. 

         a.  Sometimes the installation instructions provided with the submission are not descriptive enough to help a user find the plugin and install it for each of the Adobe applications this product supports. Please note each version of an Adobe application your product supports should have a unique set of instructions listed in the "Where to find it" section of the listing. 

         b.  If the review  team  cannot  find the files mentioned in the "Where to find it" section of your  listing, your plugin will be rejected. Please supply the path where users would find this plugin from within the Adobe product. 



#   Adobe Branding Guidelines: 

There is a predefined set of guidelines that are published by Adobe periodically for the use of Adobe assets and product icons. It is expected that developers strictly adhere to these  guidelines.  

Association with Adobe will increase acceptability within the user community and users are confident that plugins will  meet Adobe's quality standards, which developers can leverage by using Adobe assets with their products. 

Adobe does  not allow any change into  product icons.  Developers are allowed to use Adobe published assets and logos within their products, as long as they do not alter Adobe icons in any way. 

With due diligence, we expect you to thoroughly read the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf)  and follow the guidelines  exactly. Failure to do so will result in rejection during the review process.

#   Benefits & Best Practices 

## Best Practices:  

1.  **Use same developer AdobeID for both UXP and CEP plugins:**  You should always use the same developer ID to submit CEP and UXP plugins. This makes it  easier  to track plugin performance, manage your listings, and respond to user comments. 

1.  **Proper Description:**  Use the description field to explain what your plugin can do, what are its features and  functionality, and what can be achieved using the plugin. It is  very beneficial for end users if you provide a video that captures plugin functionality so that new users get a better understanding of how to use your  plugin. 

1.  **Update Your Plugin(s) Regularly:**  Updating  your plugin(s) on a regular basis to make it compatible with the latest version of the supported point product. Updating you  plugin(s) will provide an awesome and seamless experience for the end user which will reflect on your revenue and ratings. 

1.  **Share Test Credentials:**  Always share test credentials with the review team via the "Notes to Approver" section. Sharing test  credentials while submitting the listing will help us expedite the review process. 

1.  **Share a License:** Some plugins require users to enter a license key before use. If the same is to be done for your plugin and FastSpring is used to handle your  payments, you  should share 100 license keys with the review team via the "Notes to Approver" section and we will store the license keys on FastSpring. FastSpring will distribute the license key to users who have successfully purchased your  plugin. 

        a. Note: Before the current license exhaust, asupport@adobe.com will contact you to provide an additional license and they will restore the license on FastSpring so that the user can obtain the license key after purchase. 

        b. It is up to you how many licenses you want to store on FastSpring. In general, we encourage developers to share at least 100 licenses although you are free to share fewer or more license keys if you wish to do so. 


1.  **Provide Proper Installation Instructions:**  Make sure to provide proper installation instructions under the "Where to find" section, like what files users need to install, or where to place the files. If the plugin supports multiple Adobe products and the instructions are not the same for each product, then the developer must provide the installation instruction for each point product individually. (For example, if the installation instructions are different for Photoshop versus InDesign, please include the instructions for both products.) 

1.  **Follow the Adobe Brand Guidelines:** Before you use any Adobe brand asset, (for example, product icons)  you are required to  read  the  [Adobe Brand Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf)  and adhere to them. Without obtaining  proper authorization from Adobe, you should never use an  asset in your  listing or for any marketing purposes. Use of Adobe assets without prior approval will result in rejection. 

1.  **Provide Support:**  You must make sure that users can always reach out to you and inform you  of problems with your plugin. In many cases, we have seen that users give poor reviews and ratings to plugins due to a lack of communication. 

1.  **Additional Payment:** If any kind of additional payment is needed to use your  plugin, then you must share all the information about it with the user, and you must write about it in the plugin description. 

1.  **Companion application:** If any kind of additional application is required for your  plugin to work then information about this must be mentioned in the plugin description and you  should specify where the user can download the companion application.

**Question 5: How can I change the bundled ID for a CEP extension?**

*Answer:* The bundled ID is a unique identifier. Once an extension is published you can’t change the bundled ID. If you want to use a new bundled ID, you must create a new listing. 

 
**Question 6: How can I fix the following .DS_Store or macOSX error?**

 - DS_Store or _MACOSX were detected and rejected in upload due to security reasons. Please upload a new package without these files. Please contact ccintrev@adobe.com with questions. 

*Answer:* When uploading a ZXP file, you may encounter the .DS_Store or a macOSX error above. The macOS operating system adds hidden files to directories. 

***How to Delete a DS_Store File for a Specific Folder***

 

**Note:** If you’re not signed in as an administrator, you may be asked to enter your name and password to access the Terminal app and use the commands needed to delete DS_Store files. 

  1. From the desktop, select Go > Utilities > Terminal. 

  2. Locate the folder containing the DS_Store file and navigate to that directory in the Terminal. For example, if your folder is on the desktop, use the cd desktop command and press Enter. 

  3. Type find . –name '.DS_Store' –type f –delete to delete all of the .DS_Store files in the current directory and press Enter. 

  4. Select OK. The .DS_Store files in the folder you selected will be deleted. 

 

**Question 7: How can I add a collaborator, colleague, or teammate to the Exchange Portal?**

*Answer:* You may provide access to collaborators so that they may update or change your listing.  

  1. Login to the Exchange Developer Portal. 

  2. On the top right side click the “Edit Profile” button. 

  3. Now click on Add/Edit Users and click on “Invite contact”.

  5. An invitation will be sent to the requested user. 

  6. Your collaborator must complete the AdobeID registration through the email link. 

  7. Once the registration is complete, the collaborator has to create an account on Exchange Developer Portal, and after this step, the collaborator will be able to update the listing. 



**Question 8: How can I drop support for a Creative Cloud app while submitting a patch?**

*Answer:* It is not possible to drop support for Creative Cloud apps (e.g., your listing is compatible with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, but you wish to remove Photoshop support). The listing must support all point products that are supported by the first published version you submitted. 

In some cases where developers can no longer support Creative Cloud apps, they must submit a new listing and withdraw the old listing once the new listing is approved. 


**Question 9: How can I fix a server error encountered on the Exchange portal?**

*Answer:* Kindly clear the cache and cookies (at least the adobe.com cookies) before logging into the Exchange Developer Portal. If the issue persists, then please follow these steps:
