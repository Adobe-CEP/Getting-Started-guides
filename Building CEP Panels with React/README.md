# Building CEP Panels with React

A common question that comes up when building CEP Panels is whether or not one can use React. The answer is: ***yes***, you can! In fact, you can use any JavaScript framework you want, including Vue.js, AngularJS, Jquery, and more. This guide will focus on React, but the important takeaway should be "yes you can".

In this guide, we will cover how to Build a CEP panel and include the popular React JavaScript framework.

By the end of this guide, we will have an panel that:

1. Demonstrates how to set up your React CEP project
1. Renders a simple user interface using React
1. Interacts with a host application using ExtendScript

NOTE: You must download CSInterface.js to `react-panel/src/client/CSInterface.js`.
